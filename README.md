<h1>Industrial Survey For Recruitment Process</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The survey is conducted for tier-1 cities of India – Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, and Pune)</li>
    <li>This survey is targeted to collect data from IT, Finance, Legal and Higher Education sectors. (Though, we received good response from other sectors like Pharma, Consultancies, Event Management, Manufacturing and treading Sectors)</li>
</ul>
<p>The distribution of the responses is represented in Figure-1 and Figure-2. As we can observe in Figure-1 State Maharashtra shows the highest responses, because two cities, Mumbai and Pune falls under Maharashtra. Thus, the cumulative responses from both the cities are displayed in Maharashtra.</p>

    <td width=60%><p>The data is collected to check the recruitment pattern of the organization sector-wise. Figure-4 shows distribution for attempts of number of recruitments in the organization according to sector.There is a clear visibility of ‘Round the year recruitment process’ in Education, Finance, and IT sector. For legal sector once in a year recruitment seems enough and in other sectors it is based on the requirement. Thus, majority of the organizations are now flexible with the recruitment timings. So, in the market there is no season of recruitment.

 <h3>Recruitment Process</h3>
 <p>All the defined sectors have little difference in recruitment process and currently there is no specific scanning process which check the competency of the candidate. Thus, this shows the clear market requirement of system which can accurately identify the competencies from the resumes – which can be plugged into this already defined system</p>
