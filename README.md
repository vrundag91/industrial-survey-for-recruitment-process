<h1>Industrial Survey For Recruitment Process</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The survey is conducted for tier-1 cities of India – Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, and Pune)</li>
    <li>This survey is targeted to collect data from IT, Finance, Legal and Higher Education sectors. (Though, we received good response from other sectors like Pharma, Consultancies, Event Management, Manufacturing and treading Sectors)</li>
</ul>
<p>The distribution of the responses is represented in Figure-1 and Figure-2. As we can observe in Figure-1 State Maharashtra shows the highest responses, because two cities, Mumbai and Pune falls under Maharashtra. Thus, the cumulative responses from both the cities are displayed in Maharashtra.</p>

<p>To see the independent responses of the cities, refer Figure-2. It shows frequency of responses from individual city. The data points in this plot does not have any outliers, so we do not have any bias in the demographic data.</p>
